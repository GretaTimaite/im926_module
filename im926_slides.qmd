## Method

Consider a particular **method** or particular methodological approach that you would use for a doctoral research project (e.g. questionnaire, interview, observation, focus group, secondary data analysis). **Explain** the **principles** on which you would design your ‘instrument’ and the **opportunities** and **problems** you foresee and/or might experience.

## Research question 

:::{.incremental}

- Which types of experts today make knowledge claims about social aspects of AI across the sciences, engineering, social science and humanities? 

- How is epistemic relevance and authority established in the AI research field?

## 

- relational data exploration 
  - mapping and spatialisation (force-directed layouts)
- community detection (non/algorithmic)
- Interpretative turn?
- quant + qual?

## Algortihms and software

- Gephi, VosViewer, Python, R
  - degree of control and unboxing the "black box"
      - open source
  - degree of reproducibility
- Different spatialisation algorithms in different tools
  - how does it shape the understanding of a network?
- community detection 
- visualisation design
  - static/interactive
